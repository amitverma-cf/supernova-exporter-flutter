--- Prolog

Hey fellow developer! You've entered a realm of custom exporters and this package represents one.
We've provided a quick overview of what this package contains so you don't have to guess.

Note that this is only a TL/DR version. If you want to learn everything about what custom exporters
can do and their full capabilities, visit https://developers.supernova.io/, as this document provides
only a very basic information.

And finally, have fun! We appreciate you tinkering
with our tech and can't wait to see what you create with it.

For the entire team of Supernova,
Jiri, CEO and your fellow tinkerer
